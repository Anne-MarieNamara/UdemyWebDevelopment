	<p> This is regular text that isn't big or anything	</p>
	<p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing and 
	typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's
	standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
	printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
	type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
	but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
	unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
	sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
	publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
